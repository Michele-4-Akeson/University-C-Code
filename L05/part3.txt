1. Why are all the reported times zero?

the factors.c program requires less than 0.00s to execute the script (it still requires time to execute, just below the what is expressed by gprof)

2. Why is factors_itr only called once every time the program is run?

factors_itr is only called within the main function of the factors.c program and solve the problem iteratively - performs iterations, and then calls primeFactors_itr and allFactors_itr which act as helper functions to solve the function iteratively as well. factors_rec calls primeFactors_rec and allFactors_rec which are recursive functions (call themselves multiple times) 

3. Is there a mathemactical relationship between the input number and the recursive calls? What about the number of prime factors each number produces?

It does not appear as though a relationship exsits between input number and the recursive calls

primeFactors_rec calls itself equal to (n -1) times, where n is the total number of prime factors an input produces. (To be more specific, primeFactors_rec is
called in the program once for every prime factors an input has - for 300, which has prime factors 2, 2, 3, 5, 5. primeFactors is called a total of 5 times
in the program, but calls itself a total of 4 times)
